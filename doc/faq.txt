1. What is Mesh?

    Mesh is a lightweight grid middleware based on OpenSSH.  It provides
    single sign-on using standard SSH public/private key pairs and
    enforces fine-grained authorizations.


2. Why use Mesh?

    It is based on stock SSH.  You do not have to install a completely
    new infrastructure just to obtain the benefits of grid computing
    (see https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf).  No
    client-side software is needed besides a stock SSH client.

    It is easy to install and administer.  Only 5 files and 2
    environment variables are needed on hosts already running SSH.

    It is easy to use.  All services are accessed as SSH remote
    commands, which utilize the syntax, commands, and models already
    understood by users

    It adheres to fundamental security principles.  Mesh is based on
    the proven security of SSH together with additional fine-grained
    authorizations.


3. Is Mesh stable?

    Yes.  Mesh has been running in production at NASA since 2004.


4. What operating systems does Mesh support?

    In general, Mesh was designed for Unix-like systems.  The Mash
    shell, however, can run on any system with Perl (e.g. including
    Windows).  The MIA is based on the standard C library and requires a
    library preload mechanism (e.g. LD_PRELOAD, _RLD_LIST, etc.).  The
    Bypass framework, on which it's based, requires an indirect system
    call interface (i.e. syscall), which eliminates some systems such as
    AIX.


5. What operating systems has Mesh been tested on?

    Debian Linux
    Red Hat Linux
    SuSE Linux
    SGI IRIX

    The underlying Bypass framework has additionally been tested on
    Solaris and OSF/1.


6. Mesh?  MP?  MAP?  MIA?  Mash?  Mess?  What do all the acronyms mean?

    Mesh: Middleware using Existing SSH Hosts

        "Mesh computing" is like "grid computing", but designed to be
        lightweight, practical, and secure while using existing
        infrastructure.

    MP: Mesh Proxy

        The MP is the component that enforces site policy like the
        "military police" enforce military policy.

    MAP: Mesh Authentication Point

        The MAP is the component that resources consult to "find" user
        public keys.

    MIA: Mesh Interposition Agent

        The MIA is an interposition agent loaded into SSH servers that
        provides single sign-on capabilities and makes system calls
        that attempt to bypass host policy go "missing in action". ;)

    Mash: Mesh Authorization Shell

        Mash is a flexible restricted shell that "mashes" commands that
        are not authorized.

    Mess: Mesh Exec Security Shell

        Mess is a simple restricted shell that "messes" with commands
        that are not authorized.


7. Why is Mash distributed as "mash.pl" instead of "mash"?

    Because the OS X file system is case-insensitive and would put
    "mash" into the "Mash" directory.  It will be automatically
    renamed during installation.
