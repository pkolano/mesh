Meshrc Configuration
====================

Each Mesh-accessible resource enforces its own policy that specifies the
directories that may be written and the commands that may be executed.
Write authorizations are enforced at the system call level by the Mesh
Interposition Agent (MIA).  Execute authorizations are enforced by the
Mess Exec Security Shell (Mess), which is a restricted shell that is
dynamically executed by the MIA in place of the user's default login
shell.  See the discussion in https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf
for details.

Note that because the MIA uses library preloading, *ONLY* dynamically
linked executables are subject to host authorizations.  To enforce
authorizations on statically linked executables, you must use a
different approach such as systrace (http://systrace.org).

The policy for write and execute authorizations is split into two
"meshrc" files: a global file defined by the administrator and an
individual file defined by each user.


1. Global meshrc

    The global meshrc file is located at "$PREFIX/etc/mesh/meshrc",
    where "$PREFIX" is the value of "--prefix" given to configure during
    installation.  This file contains the policy applicable to all
    users.

    1.1. Write authorizations

        A directory "/dir" and all files and directories beneath that
        directory (i.e. /dir/*/*/.../*) may be written by all users
        (still subject to normal file system permissions), if the global 
        meshrc contains a line:

            /dir

        Note that a single slash by itself (i.e. the root directory)
        will be ignored.  That is, writes cannot simply be authorized to
        every single directory on the file system.  Also note that dot
        files (i.e. ~/.*) in user home directories are never writable
        regardless of the contents of the global or user meshrc file.

    1.2. Basic execute authorizations

        A command "/path/to/command" is allowed to execute on a system
        if the global meshrc contains a line:

            +x /path/to/command

    1.3. Extended execute authorizations

        Any command authorized using "+x /path/to/command" may have an
        extended rule of the form:
        
            +command <Getopt string> <Perl string>
            
        Extended rules can be used to restrict command execution even
        further.  The Getopt string consists of a string in either
        Perl Getopt::Std or Getopt::Long format.  In Getopt::Long form,
        option definitions must separated by commas (e.g. an integer
        option "--iarg" and a string option "--sarg" would be specified
        "iarg=i,sarg=s").

        The Perl string consists of arbitrary Perl code that must return
        a true value at the time the given command is executed.
        Otherwise, the command will not be allowed to execute.
        Several shorthands are defined within Mess:

            "o(option)" is short for "$opts{option}", where %opts is the
            (internal) hash in which the results of Getopt::Std or
            Getopt::Long parsing are stored.  

            "a(index)" is short for "$ARGV[index]".  An "a" by itself
            is short for "scalar(@ARGV)".  The size of @ARGV is computed
            after option parsing so will only include actual arguments.

            "rc(index)" is short for "$rc[index]", where @rc is the
            (internal) list of arguments obtained from the user's
            individual meshrc file.  For example, if the user executed
            the command "/path/to/command" and the user meshrc contained
            a line "+command zero one two", "rc(0)" would evaluate to
            "zero", "rc(1)" to "one", etc.

            "w(path)" returns true if the base directory of the given
            path has been authorized for writes in the global or user
            meshrc.

        The following example of an extended rule for the PBS qsub
        command illustrates the power of this capability.  Note that
        this example has been numbered and expanded for clarity.  The
        meshrc format expects everything on a single line and does not
        support line numbers or typical string semantics allowing
        strings within open quotes across multiple lines.

                +qsub 'hzIVa:c:e:j:k:l:m:o:p:q:r:u:v:A:C:J:M:N:S:W:' '
            (1)     a >= 1 &&
            (2)     !w(a(0)) &&
            (3)     a(0) eq rc(0) &&
            (4)     o(e) !~ /:/ && o(o) !~ /:/ &&
            (5)     o(v) !~ /LD_|_RLD_/ &&
            (6)     o(W) !~ /interactive|stage/ &&
            (7)     !o(I) && !o(S) && !o(u) && !o(V) &&
            (8)     (w(o(e)) || !o(e) && (w(o(o)) || !o(o)) &&
            (9)     getpwuid($<) =~ /^(user1|user2))$/'

        This rule specifies that qsub can take options {h, z, I, V}
        without values and options {a, c, e, j, k, l, m, o, p, q, r, u,
        v, A, C, J, M, N, S, W} with values and can only be executed
        when all of the following conditions hold:

            1. There is one or more arguments
            2. The base directory of the first argument is not
               authorized for writes
            3. The first argument appears as the first element of one
               of the +qsub extended rules in the user's ~/.meshrc
            4. Neither the -e nor -o option values contain ":"
            5. The -v option value does not contain "LD_" or "_RLD_"
            6. The -W option value does not contain "interactive" or "stage"
            7. None of the options -I, -S, -u, or -V were specified
            8. The base directories of both the -e and -o option values
               are authorized for writes or not specified
            9. The invoking user is either "user1" or "user2"


2. User meshrc

    Each user has a meshrc file located at "~/.meshrc".  This file
    contains a policy applicable only to the given user.  As a fail-safe
    default, if this file does not exist, the user cannot execute any
    commands on the system.  Thus, the accounts of users who have no
    knowledge or need of Mesh are completely protected.

    1.1. Write authorizations

        Users may authorize additional directories beyond those
        specified in the global meshrc.  A directory "/dir" and all
        files and directories beneath that directory (i.e.
        /dir/*/*/.../*) may be written by a given user (still subject to
        normal file system permissions), if that user's meshrc
        contains a line:

            /dir

        Note that a single slash by itself (i.e. the root directory)
        will be ignored.  That is, writes cannot simply be authorized to
        every single directory on the file system.  Also note that dot
        files (i.e. ~/.*) in user home directories are never writable
        regardless of the contents of the global or user meshrc file.

        Finally, note that the MIA restricts writes by every process
        spawned by the SSH daemon including the daemon itself, thus it
        may be desirable to authorize certain directories for the root
        user such as those for PID files (i.e. /var/run), devices
        (i.e. /dev), etc.

    1.2. Execute deauthorizations

        Users cannot authorize additional commands, but can deauthorize
        globally authorized commands if they have no need of them.  The
        following line deauthorizes a command "/path/to/command"
        authorized in the global meshrc:

            -x /path/to/command

    1.3. Extended rule arguments

        Any global extended execute authorizations "+command ..." that
        reference either "$rc[]" or its shorthand "rc()" require the
        user to provide parameters using a meshrc line:
        
            +command parameter0 parameter1 ... parameterN
        
        The parameter(s) will be used while evaluating the global
        extended rule to determine if the given command can execute.
        For the qsub extended rule given as an example above, a
        corresponding user meshrc parameter example would be:

            +qsub /path/to/pbs/script
