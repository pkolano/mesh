Using the Mesh Virtual File System (VFS)<br>
<br>

<hr>
<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
<br>

    The <a href="usage.html#client">Mesh client</a> includes a virtual file
    system (VFS) capability that allows files across all Mesh-enabled
    resources to be accessed using standard file system commands.  For
    example, the command:
    

    <pre>    ls host1:/tmp</pre>

    would list the files in /tmp on host1.  The command:

    <pre>    cp foobar host1:/tmp</pre>

    would copy the file "foobar" from the current directory on the
    local host to /tmp on host1.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    The set of <a href="#commands">supported commands</a> includes
    cat, cd, chgrp, chmod, chown, cmp, cp, df, diff, du, file, grep,
    head, less, ln, ls, mkdir, more, mv, pwd, rm, rmdir, tail, tee,
    test, touch, and wc.  Note that this functionality is not a true
    file system since only these commands are supported and only when
    used from within a shell.  Unlike more general approaches such as <a
    href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">FUSE</a>, however, the Mesh
    capability is completely portable and can be enabled with no
    additional privileges or software.
    
    <br>
    <br>

    Commands through the VFS functionality can act on any combination of
    local and remote files, where remote files are prefixed with
    "host:" similar to scp syntax.  For example, the command:
    
    <pre>    cat host1:/tmp/rfile ~/lfile</pre>

    would print the file "rfile" in /tmp on host1 as well as the file
    "lfile" in the user's home directory on the local host to the
    terminal.  Any number of hosts can be included in any command.  For
    example, the command:

    <pre>    diff host1:/tmp/host1_file host2:/tmp/host2_file</pre>
    
    would show the differences between the file "host1_file" in /tmp on
    host1 and the file "host2_file" in /tmp on host2.  The client
    determines if any remote access is needed based on the path(s)
    given.  If not, it will execute the command locally as given as
    rapidly as possible.  Fully local commands also support all options
    with the exception of options of the form "-f value" (i.e.
    single-dash options that take values).

<b>VFS Activation</b>
<br>

    <ul>
    <li>Requirements
    <br>
    <br>

        Currently, Mesh VFS functionality is <b>only supported for
        bash</b>, but csh support is planned for the future.  This
        functionality <b>requires Perl version 5.8.5</b> (note that this
        is more recent than version 5.6.1 required by the <a
        href="usage.html">basic client functionality</a>).  It also
        <b>requires the standard Unix utilities cat, column, false,
        sort, and true</b> and has been tested successfully on Linux, OS
        X, and Windows under <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
        and <a href="http://www.colinux.org">coLinux</a>.  Note that
        users of Windows under <a
        href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> may need to install the
        coreutils and util-linux packages to obtain these utilities.  

        <br>
        <br>

    </li>
    <li>Activation/Deactivation
    <br>
    <br>
        <ol>

        <li><a href="usage.html#client">Install the Mesh client</a> if
        you have not already done so

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        <li>Activate VFS functionality in a bash shell
        <pre>	eval `mc -s bash`</pre>

        This will load aliases and functions used to intercept specific
        commands and replace them with commands through the Mesh client
        that perform the actions requested.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        <li>Deactivate VFS functionality in a bash shell whenever desired
        <pre>	eval `mc -r bash`</pre>
        </li>

        </ol>

    </li>
    <li>Command-line Options
    <br>
    <br>

        The behavior of the virtual file system can be modified using
        various options at the time it is activated.

        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <li>-ocmd=opts
        <br>
        <br>

        Specify default options for a given command since the VFS
        functionality overrides any existing aliases for its supported
        set of commands.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        <li>-t transport
        <br>
        <br>

        Change the file transport from its "sftp" default to
        "transport".  Currently, the only additional transport available
        is "bbftp".  Note that using bbftp as the transport may slow
        down certain operations on small files as bbftp has higher
        startup overhead.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>

        <li>-u user
        <br>
        <br>

        Specify user name.  Note that this option <b>is required
        if your local user name differs from your user name within the
        target Mesh domain and you have not modified your <a
        href="usage.html#sshconf">SSH configuration</a> appropriately</b>.

        </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        For example, the following invocation activates the client
        virtual file system using bbftp as the transport mechanism,
        "user1" as the user and adds colorization of local file
        listings using the Linux ls "--color=always" option.

        <pre>	eval `mc -s bash -t bbftp -u user1 -ols=--color=always`</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>

<hr>
<b>VFS Caveats</b>
<br>
<br>

    The VFS functionality is still somewhat experimental.  In general,
    it works for the most common usage scenarios with some caveats.  In
    particular:

        <ul>
        <li>
        
        "Whole file" commands (i.e. commands that must process the
        entire file), including cat, cmp, diff, grep, wc (and currently
        more/less due to implementation) retrieve files first before
        processing for efficiency.  Thus, these commands should not be
        executed on very large files.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>
        
        There is a conflict between commands that take piped input and
        the custom globbing of the client, thus these commands have
        portions of globbing support disabled.  These commands are grep,
        head, less, more, tail, tee, and wc.  In these cases, globbing
        will work for absolute prefixes, but not relative.  For example,
        "grep foo host1:/tmp/*" will work, but "cd host1:/tmp; grep
        foo *" will not.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>
        
        Redirection to/from remote files doesn't work.  The same effect
        can be achieved using cat and tee (e.g. "grep localhost
        &lt;host1:/etc/hosts &gt;a" would become "cat host1:/etc/hosts
        |grep localhost |tee a &gt;/dev/null").  Redirection still works
        normally for local files.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>
        
        The first time a command is run involving a particular host, a
        SFTP connection is created to that host.  When running "ps", it
        may appear as if a zombie client process is running.

        <br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li>
        
        Commands may hang the first time after switching networks
        (e.g. with a laptop).  If this happens, hit Control-c and it
        will work the next time.

        </li>
        </ul>

<b>VFS Commands</b>
<br>
<br>

    Currently supported commands and their currently supported options
    are below.  Unsupported options will simply be ignored except where
    noted.  All commands are still subject to <a
    href="usage.html#authorizations">Mesh authorizations</a>, thus
    something that cannot be executed or written normally through
    Mesh cannot be executed or written through this functionality
    either.

    <br>
    <ul>
    <li><b>cat (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>cd (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that when changing to remote directories, cd only changes
        $PWD so to make changes visible, the working directory (i.e. \w
        in bash) must be in your prompt.  For example, the following
        prompt:

        <pre>    export PS1="\h:\w&gt; "</pre>

        would display the current host name followed by the current
        working directory.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>chgrp (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Groups may be specified either by number or by name.  Names
        will be resolved on the remote host.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>chmod (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Modes must be specified numerically (e.g. 0700).  Symbolic
        modes, such as a+rX, are not currently supported.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>chown (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Users and groups may be specified either by number or by name.
        Names will be resolved on the remote host.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>cmp (all options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>cp [-r]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that copies between two remote hosts transfer files to
        the local host first since Mesh does not allow third party
        transfers.  Thus, very large file transfers between remote
        systems should be achieved using an alternate approach.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>df [-i]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that 1024-byte blocks are used.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>diff (all options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>du [-a] [-b] [-s]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that 1024-byte blocks are used.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>file (all options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>grep (all options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>head [-number]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that head does not support the form "-n number", thus,
        for example, to display the first 5 lines of a file, use "-5"
        and not "-n 5".

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>less (all options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>ln [-s]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that hard links are not supported.  Links from remote files
        to local files (e.g. ln -s host1:/foo /foo) will be dereferenced
        during certain operations (e.g. cat /foo will cat host1:/foo).
        
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>ls [-1] [-d] [-l]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        For efficiency purposes, ls behaves slightly differently for
        remote commands than for local.  In particular "ls -l" will not
        show links by default and will show what is actually linked
        instead of the link itself.  Link details can be obtained using
        the "-d" option (e.g.  ls -ld *).

    <br>
    <br>

        Also for efficiency, ls processes remote files before local
        files, so output ordering may be changed when remote and local
        files are interleaved on the ls command line.  For example, "ls
        /foo host1: /bar" would show host1: first, then /foo, then /bar.

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>mkdir (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>more (all options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>mv (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>pwd (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>rm [-r]</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>rmdir (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>tail [-number]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that tail does not support the form "-n number", thus, for
        example, to display the last 5 lines of a file, use "-5" and
        not "-n 5".

    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>tee [-a]</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>test [-b] [-c] [-d] [-e] [-f] [-g] [-h] [-k] [-L] [-p] [-r] [-s] [-S] [-u] [-w]</b>
    <br>
    <br>

        Note that compound and string tests are not supported.
        Compound and string tests can be achieved using multiple test
        commands separated by shell compound operators.  For example,

        <pre>    test -f host1:/foo -a "abc" != "123"</pre>

        would become

        <pre>    test -f host1:/foo &amp;&amp; test "abc" != "123"</pre>

        Alternatively, the "actual" test command can be executed
        through Mesh:
    
        <pre>    mc ssh host1 test -f /foo -a "abc" != "123"</pre>

    </li>
    <li><b>touch (no options)</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </li>
    <li><b>wc (all options)</b>
    </li>
    </ul>
