Mesh Installation and Configuration
===================================

It is strongly recommended that this entire document be read before
beginning installation.  Because portions of Mesh operate within the SSH
daemon of a host, which is typically its only access point besides its
console, a Mesh installation can cut off access to that host if not
performed correctly.  Initially, it is suggested that Mesh be installed
using secondary SSH daemons until its functionality can be verified.
See the deployments section for details.


1. Deployments

    Before installation, the type of deployment must be chosen.
    Deployments are based on the three major capabilities of single
    sign-on, proxying (with fine-grained authorizations), and host-level
    authorizations.  These capabilities roughly correspond to the Mesh
    Authentication Point (MAP), the Mesh Proxy (MP), and the Mesh
    Interposition Agent (MIA), respectively.  For a full understanding
    of these components, see https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf

    Single sign-on allows the same user credentials to be used for
    authentication both within and, if desired, across organizational
    units.  Proxying protects internal resources from direct attack by
    using a secure bastion host that vets all commands before they reach
    the target.  Host-level authorizations protect internal resources
    at the system call level against either a compromise of the proxy or
    malicious user behavior.  Mesh can be deployed to support any
    combination of these capabilities.

    Each deployment option is briefly described below.
    
    1.1. Single sign-on, proxying, and authorizations (standard deployment)

        This deployment utilizes an MP host to proxy all requests to
        resources, a MAP host to provide public keys to resources and
        other MAPs, and a set of resource hosts on which remote commands
        may execute.  This deployment requires an MP install, a MAP
        install, and one or more resource installs.

    1.2. Single sign-on and proxying (no authorizations)

        This deployment is identical to the standard deployment except
        commands are not restricted in any way once they reach resources.
        Commands are still vetted by the MP.  This deployment requires
        an MP install, a MAP install, and one or more resource installs.

    1.3. Proxying and authorizations (no single sign-on)

        In this deployment, commands are vetted by the MP before they
        reach resources and by the MIA on the resource itself, but no
        Mesh authentication mechanisms are utilized.  This deployment
        requires an MP install and one or more resource installs.

    1.4. Single sign-on and authorizations (no proxying)

        In this deployment, resources may be accessed directly from the
        network, with the MIA/MAP used to provide a simple single
        sign-on environment for SSH as well as low-level authorizations
        on resources.  This deployment requires a MAP install and one
        or more resource installs.

    1.5. Single sign-on (no proxying or authorizations)

        In this deployment, resources may be accessed directly from the
        network, with the MIA/MAP used to provide a simple single
        sign-on environment for SSH.  Successfully authenticated
        commands execute without restriction on resources.  This
        deployment requires a MAP install and one or more resource
        installs.

    1.6. Authorizations (no single sign-on or proxying)

        Low-level authorizations may be used on any host independent of
        an MP or MAP.  These authorizations enforce restrictions on
        what files may be executed and written.  This deployment
        requires one or more resource installs.

    1.7. Proxying/Mash (no single sign-on or authorizations)

        A proxying-only deployment is equivalent to a Mesh Authorization
        Shell (Mash) deployment.  Mash is a highly restrictive and
        customizable login shell that supports fine-grained
        authorizations of commands.  It may be used on any host
        independent of the MP or MAP to provide a restricted execution
        environment.  For example, it can be used as a more flexible
        alternative to scponly (http://sublimation.org/scponly) or rssh
        (http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh).  This deployment requires one
        or more MP installs.

    1.8. Combined MP/MAP

        With a corresponding decrease in security, the MP and MAP
        functionality may be combined on a single host.  See the
        discussion in https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf
        for details.  This deployment requires an MP install and one or
        more resource installs.

    1.9. Multiple SSH daemons per host

        On any of the MP, the MAP, or resources, the MIA may run within
        the primary SSH daemon on port 22 or within a second dedicated
        SSH daemon on an alternate port.  This decision should be made
        before any SSH daemon configuration is altered.  Those not
        familiar with Mesh may initially wish to use secondary daemons
        until its functionality can be verified.  The initial
        configuration of these secondary daemons is outside the scope of
        this document.  See "man sshd" and/or "man sshd_config" for
        details.

3. Installation

    Installation uses the standard "configure; make; make install"
    process.  The configure command specifies various parameters that
    impact installation behavior.  The type of install is specified
    using the "--type" parameter with a value of "mp", "map", or
    "resource".  The installation prefix is specified using the
    "--prefix" parameter with the base directory path.  Single sign-on
    is enabled by default, but may be explicitly disabled using the
    "--disable-sso" option.  MP and MAP installs also may be given a
    "--group" parameter with the name of the designated Mesh group.
    Run "configure --help" for all options and defaults.

    3.1. MP installation

        3.1.1. Single sign-on enabled

            The following example command line would configure a
            standard MP install with an installation prefix of "/" and
            a Mesh group of "mesh":

                configure        \
                    --type=mp    \
                    --prefix=/   \
                    --group=mesh

            Note that only the "--type" option is required as the other
            options have default values.

            The software is built using:

                make

            Note that configure and make do not have to be run on the
            final installation target.  For example, if a compiler is
            not installed on the actual MP host, configure and make can
            be run on another host.  Afterwards, the distribution
            directory can be copied to the actual MP, where the
            installation may then continue.  Mesh is installed using:

                make install

            Note that this step requires root privileges.  Also,
            before this step, the group specified in the "--group"
            configure option must be manually created, if it does not
            already exist.

        3.1.2. Single sign-on disabled

            The following example command line would configure an MP
            install with single sign-on disabled and an installation
            prefix of "/":

                configure         \
                    --type=mp     \
                    --prefix=/    \
                    --disable-sso

            The make step is not necessary in this case as the code is
            pure Perl.  Mesh is installed using:

                make install

            Note that this step requires root privileges.

    3.2. MAP installation

        The following example command line would configure a MAP install
        with an installation prefix of "/" and a Mesh group of "mesh":

            configure        \
                --type=map   \
                --prefix=/   \
                --group=mesh

        Note that only the "--type" option is required as the other
        options have default values.

        The software is built using:

            make

        Note that configure and make do not have to be run on the final
        installation target.  For example, if a compiler is not
        installed on the actual MAP host, configure and make can be run
        on another host.  Afterwards, the distribution directory can be
        copied to the actual MAP, where the installation may then
        continue.  Mesh is installed using:

            make install

        Note that this step requires root privileges.  Also, before
        this step, the group specified in the "--group" configure option
        must be manually created, if it does not already exist.

    3.3. Resource installation

        3.3.1. Single sign-on enabled

            The following example command line would configure a
            standard resource install with an installation prefix of "/".

                configure           \
                    --type=resource \
                    --prefix=/

            Note that only the "--type" option is required as the
            other options have default values.

            The software is built using:

                make

            Note that configure and make do not have to be run on the
            final installation target.  For example, if a compiler is
            not installed on the actual resource, configure and make can
            be run on another host.  Afterwards, the distribution
            directory can be copied to the final target, where the
            installation may then continue.  Mesh is installed using:

                make install

            Note that this step requires root privileges.

        3.3.2. Single sign-on disabled

            The following example command line would configure a
            resource install with single sign-on disabled and an
            installation prefix of "/".

                configure           \
                    --type=resource \
                    --prefix=/      \
                    --disable-sso

            The software is built using:

                make

            Note that configure and make do not have to be run on the
            final installation target.  For example, if a compiler is
            not installed on the actual resource, configure and make can
            be run on another host.  Afterwards, the distribution
            directory can be copied to the final target, where the
            installation may then continue.  Mesh is installed using:

                make install

            Note that this step requires root privileges.


4. Configuration

    Note in all cases, $PREFIX refers to the prefix directory given to
    configure in the installation phase (or "/usr/local" if the
    "--prefix" option was not specified).

    4.1. MP configuration

        4.1.1. /etc/mesh/mesh.conf

            A skeleton for this file is auto-generated during
            installation, which contains name-value pairs describing
            basic properties of Mesh.  Any items listed under the MP
            sections in the auto-generated config file should be
            reviewed.  Any uncommented items in these sections must be
            configured (uncommented items in other sections can be
            ignored or commented out if they are not being used by
            another Mesh component).  For the MP, these include:

                map_host
                map_print
                mp_host
                mp_print
                self_host

        4.1.2. /etc/mesh/mashrc

            A skeleton for this file is auto-generated during
            installation, which contains an XML description of
            authorized commands and restrictions on those commands
            enforced by Mash.  See "doc/mashrc.txt" for details of Mash
            configuration.

            Note that no further configuration is needed beyond this
            point when single sign-on is disabled.

        4.1.3. /etc/mesh/mapkeys

            This directory contains SSH private keys for the MPs of
            foreign VOs (see https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf).
            These keys are used to retrieve public keys from foreign
            MPs and to map user names between VOs.  Keys must be named
            to include the user, the host, and the port on that host.
            For example, the following:

                mpuser@mp.example.com:1234

            should contain a private key to access user "mpuser" on host
            "mp.example.com" where the SSH daemon on that host is
            operating on port 1234.

            Note that the mapkeys directory on the MP should contain
            keys for foreign MPs while the mapkeys directory on the
            MAP should contain keys for foreign MAPs.

        4.1.4. /etc/passwd (or equivalent)

            This file contains user account entries.  All normal users
            (i.e. excluding system accounts such as "root", "nobody",
            etc.) should have their login shell set to $PREFIX/bin/mash.
            Administrative users with Mash as their login shell must
            be explicitly allowed to run a different shell in
            /etc/mesh/mashrc.  See "doc/mashrc.txt" for details of Mash
            configuration and "etc/mashrc.mp" for examples of
            administrative setup.

            An account must exist on the MP corresponding to the value
            of "mesh_user" in mesh.conf that is in the Mesh group
            originally specified by the configure "--group" option.
            Similarly, any accounts used by foreign MPs to retreive
            public keys must also be configured in this file and be
            members of the Mesh group.  The login shell of all such
            accounts must be $PREFIX/bin/mash.

        4.1.5. /etc/init.d/sshd (or equivalent)

            This file contains commands for invoking the SSH daemon.
            For Linux/BSD, the environment in which the SSH daemon
            executes must contain the settings:

                LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so
                MESH_LOCK=0

            For IRIX, the LD_PRELOAD setting must be changed to:

                _RLD_LIST=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so:DEFAULT:libgen.so:libC.so.2

            These settings can be achieved by adding an appropriate
            "env" command.  For example, on a Debian system, the
            following:

                start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid \
                    --exec /usr/sbin/sshd --startas /usr/bin/env --           \
                    LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so MESH_LOCK=0          \
                    /usr/sbin/sshd $SSHD_OPTS

            invokes the SSH daemon with the required environment
            settings.

        4.1.6. /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or equivalent)

            This file contains SSH daemon configuration.  The only
            required setting is:

                PubkeyAuthentication yes

            Note that this is the default setting in OpenSSH.

        4.1.7. /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts (or equivalent)

            This file contains SSH public keys for known hosts.  This
            file should include a public key for the local MAP as well
            as public keys for all foreign MPs for which there is a
            private key in /etc/mesh/mapkeys.  This file can be
            populated using the "ssh-keyscan" command.  For example,
            the following:

                ssh-keyscan -t rsa -p 1234 map.example.com \
                    >>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

            can be used to retrieve the public RSA key of host
            "map.example.com" on port 1234 and append it to
            /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.

        4.1.8. /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root (or equivalent)

            A root crontab may optionally be defined to collect stats
            on a periodic basis.  The $PREFIX/sbin/mesh-logstats command
            takes a syslog stream on stdin and produces a set of result
            tables on stdout.

            # Collect daily Mesh usage stats at 8am and save in /dir
            #   (assumes syslog of previous day in /var/log/syslog.0)
            0 8 * * * $PREFIX/sbin/mesh-logstats </var/log/syslog.0 \
                >/dir/mesh.`/bin/date +%m.%d.%y`

        4.1.9. $PREFIX/var/meshkeys/$USER

            Any private keys distributed to foreign MPs for public key
            retrieval must have the corresponding public key stored on
            the local MP in meshkeys directory under the user
            corresponding to the account for which the private key is
            valid.  This key must be owned by the same user and have
            permissions 644 (i.e. read and write by owner and read by
            group/others).

    4.2. MAP configuration

        4.2.1. /etc/mesh/mesh.conf

            A skeleton for this file is auto-generated during
            installation, which contains name-value pairs describing
            basic properties of Mesh.  Any items listed under the MAP
            sections in the auto-generated config file should be
            reviewed.  Any uncommented items in these sections must be
            configured (uncommented items in other sections can be
            ignored or commented out if they are not being used by
            another Mesh component).  For the MAP, these include:

                map_host
                mp_host
                self_host

        4.2.2. /etc/mesh/mashrc

            A skeleton for this file is auto-generated during
            installation, which contains an XML description of
            authorized commands and restrictions on those commands
            enforced by Mash.  See "doc/mashrc.txt" for details of
            Mash configuration.

        4.2.3. /etc/mesh/mapkeys

            This directory contains SSH private keys for the MAPs of
            foreign VOs (see https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf).
            These keys are used to retrieve public keys from foreign
            MAPs and to map user names between VOs.  Keys must be named
            to include the user, the host, and the port on that host.
            For example, the following:

                mapuser@map.example.com:1234

            should contain a private key to access user "mapuser" on
            host "map.example.com" where the SSH daemon on that host is
            operating on port 1234.

            Note that the mapkeys directory on the MP should contain
            keys for foreign MPs while the mapkeys directory on the
            MAP should contain keys for foreign MAPs.

        4.2.4. /etc/passwd (or equivalent)

            This file contains user account entries.  All normal users
            (i.e. excluding system accounts such as "root", "nobody",
            etc.) should have their login shell set to $PREFIX/bin/mash.
            Administrative users with Mash as their login shell must
            be explicitly allowed to run a different shell in
            /etc/mesh/mashrc.  See "doc/mashrc.txt" for details of Mash
            configuration and "etc/mashrc.map" for examples of
            administrative setup.

            An account must exist on the MAP corresponding to the value
            of "mesh_user" in the MP/resource mesh.conf that is in the
            Mesh group originally specified by the configure "--group"
            option.  Similarly, any accounts used by foreign MAPs to
            retreive public keys must also be configured in this file
            and be members of the Mesh group.  The login shell of all
            such accounts must be $PREFIX/bin/mash.

        4.2.5. /etc/init.d/sshd (or equivalent)

            This file contains commands for invoking the SSH daemon.
            For Linux/BSD, the environment in which the SSH daemon
            executes must contain the settings:

                LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so
                MESH_LOCK=0

            For IRIX, the LD_PRELOAD setting must be changed to:

                _RLD_LIST=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so:DEFAULT:libgen.so:libC.so.2

            These settings can be achieved by adding an appropriate
            "env" command.  For example, on a Debian system, the
            following:

                start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid \
                    --exec /usr/sbin/sshd --startas /usr/bin/env --           \
                    LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so MESH_LOCK=0          \
                    /usr/sbin/sshd $SSHD_OPTS

            invokes the SSH daemon with the required environment
            settings.

        4.2.6. /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or equivalent)

            This file contains SSH daemon configuration.  The only
            required setting is:

                PubkeyAuthentication yes

            Note that this is the default setting in OpenSSH.

        4.2.7. /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts (or equivalent)

            This file contains SSH public keys for known hosts.  This
            file should include a public key for all foreign MAPs for
            which there is a private key in /etc/mesh/mapkeys.  This
            file can be populated using the "ssh-keyscan" command.  For
            example, the following:

                ssh-keyscan -t rsa -p 1234 map.example.com \
                    >>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

            can be used to retrieve the public RSA key of host
            "map.example.com" on port 1234 and append it to
            /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.

        4.2.8. /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root (or equivalent)

            A root crontab may optionally be defined to collect stats
            on a periodic basis.  The $PREFIX/sbin/mesh-logstats command
            takes a syslog stream on stdin and produces a set of result
            tables on stdout.

            # Collect daily Mesh usage stats at 8am and save in /dir
            #   (assumes syslog of previous day in /var/log/syslog.0)
            0 8 * * * /bin/cat /var/log/syslog.0 $PREFIX/sbin/mesh-logstats \
                >/dir/mesh.`/bin/date +%m.%d.%y`

        4.2.9. /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys (or equivalent)

            Any private keys distributed to foreign MAPs for public
            key retrieval must have the corresponding public key stored
            on the local MAP in the home directory of the user
            corresponding to the account for which the private key is
            valid.  This key must be owned by the same user and have
            permissions 600 (i.e. read and write by owner).

    4.3. Resource configuration

        4.3.1. /etc/mesh/mesh.conf

            A skeleton for this file is auto-generated during
            installation, which contains name-value pairs describing
            basic properties of Mesh.  Any items listed under the
            resource sections in the auto-generated config file should
            be reviewed.  Any uncommented items in these sections must
            be configured (uncommented items in other sections can be
            ignored or commented out if they are not being used by
            another Mesh component).  On resources, these include:

                map_host

        4.3.2. /etc/mesh/meshrc

            A skeleton for this file is auto-generated during
            installation, which contains a list of globally authorized
            commands that may be executed and globally authorized
            directories that may be written.  These restrictions are
            enforced by the MIA.  See "doc/meshrc.txt" for details of
            this configuration file.

        4.3.3. /etc/mesh/mapkeys/local

            This file contains an SSH private key to retrieve public
            keys from the local MAP.  An SSH key pair can be generated
            using:

                ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/mesh/mapkeys/local

            The contents of the resulting file "/etc/mesh/mapkeys/local.pub"
            must be appended to the file "/home/mapuser/.ssh/authorized_keys"
            on map.example.com (assuming the root of home directories is the
            standard "/home").

            Note that this file is not required if single sign-on is
            disabled.

        4.3.4. /etc/init.d/sshd (or equivalent)

            This file contains commands for invoking the SSH daemon.
            For Linux/BSD, the environment in which the SSH daemon
            executes must contain the setting:

                LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so

            For IRIX, the LD_PRELOAD setting must be changed to:

                _RLD_LIST=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so:DEFAULT:libgen.so:libC.so.2

            Optionally, the setting:

                MESH_LOCK=0

            may be included to disable host-level authorizations.  Also
            optionally, the setting:

                MESH_HOOK=0
            
            may be included to disable single sign-on.  Finally, the
            optional setting:

                MESH_MP_IPS="<space separated list of IPv4/v6 addresses>"

            may be included to use single sign-on and host-level
            authorizations only when a command has been invoked from a
            specific host.  This is typically used with MP IP addresses
            to permit single sign-on for commands passing through the
            MP, but to disallow it otherwise.  This allows a single SSH
            daemon to support both traditional SSH authentication
            without additional authorizations as well as Mesh single
            sign-on and host-level authorizations.  See the discussion
            in https://pkolano.github.io/papers/sacmat07.pdf for
            details.  Note that this setting is currently inoperable on
            IRIX systems due to a problem intercepting the "accept"
            system call.  Note that the setting:

                MESH_MP_IPS=""
            
            disables both single sign-on and host-level authorizations.
            These settings can be achieved by adding an appropriate
            "env" command.  For example, on a Debian system, the
            following:

                start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile /var/run/sshd.pid \
                    --exec /usr/sbin/sshd --startas /usr/bin/env --           \
                    LD_PRELOAD=$PREFIX/lib/mesh_agent.so                      \
                    MESH_MP_IPS="192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2"                     \
                    /usr/sbin/sshd $SSHD_OPTS

            invokes the SSH daemon with the MIA loaded and a MESH_MP_IPS
            setting that will only allow single sign-on when a command
            has been invoked through either "192.168.1.1" or
            "192.168.1.2".

        4.3.5. /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or equivalent)

            This file contains SSH daemon configuration.  The only
            required setting is:

                PubkeyAuthentication yes

            Note that this is the default setting in OpenSSH.

        4.3.6. /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts (or equivalent)

            This file contains SSH public keys for known hosts.  This
            file should include a public key for the local MAP.  This
            file can be populated using the "ssh-keyscan" command.  For
            example, the following:

                ssh-keyscan -t rsa -p 1234 map.example.com \
                    >>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

            can be used to retrieve the public RSA key of host
            "map.example.com" on port 1234 and append it to
            /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.


5. Activation

    Once Mesh has been configured, the appropriate SSH daemons on the
    MP, MAP, and/or resources must be restarted.  This is typically
    achieved through the corresponding "/etc/init.d" script:

        /etc/init.d/sshd restart

    Note that if Mesh is installed into the primary SSH daemon on a
    host, a separate root session should be left open in case any
    problems are encountered (console access is also recommended).
